# What is our game about? 
ProjectNurture is an educational game that educates players on the various plants that can be homegrown in Singapore. In an immersive VR space with visual and audio feedback, users get to learn how to plant using proper procedures as in reality. Plants like Chilli, Tomato and Taro can be grown and every plant has a unique characteristic that is distinct from the rest, such as requiring different environmental conditions to grow in. Our goal is to cultivate the love for farming by farming in the VR space before considering growing plants in reality. So, take a look at ProjectNurture!

In the past year as COVID19 sweeps the globe, Singapore's food supply has been challenged as it dwindles due to panic buying. There is therefore an national initiative to reduce dependency on food imports with the SG "30 by 30" vision where by 30% of Singapore's nutritional needs will be produced locally in urban farms by 2030. With our game, we hope to garner interest and knowledge about farming in more people in preparation for the day.

The player can move via teleportation within this area. To teleport, press the B button and point to an area to teleport. You can also move via pushing the joystick button 8 on the left hand.</li>

<li>The player can follow the instructions on the signboard, and equip the farming tools on the table on the right via any controller. To do this, click the TRIGGER + GRIP buttons on either controller to grab an item. This mechanism applies to the tools and plants.</li>

<li>Detailed Steps: Hold the short spade on your hand and use it to dig on the dirt mound, pour the seeds from the seed bag onto the dirt mount, cover the dirt mount with dirt by tapping it with the short spade, grab the watercan to water the plot until indicated water level is reached, lastly, pluck the grown veges using your hands to harvest the plant. Once you are done, there is a Quiz at the Quiz Area that you can attempt to test your knowledge!</li>

<li>Each plot of land corresponds to the growth of a plant. Light Brown Soil (Sandy Clay Loam Soil) is for Tomato. Dark Brown Soil (Well-drained Soil) is for Chilli. Observe what happens when you follow the instructions.</li>
